## Idea:
According to the Feynman Technique, if you can't explain a concept simply, you don't understand it well enough. Therefore, to fully grasp an idea, one should be able to explain it in a way a 5-year-old could understand. This process requires finding an audience interested in the same topic. Our platform provides just thatâ€”a place where people can connect with others who share their interests. This setup is a win-win: the explainer gets to deepen their understanding of the topic, while the listener learns something new. Furthermore, the explainer can receive feedback from the listener and improve their explanation. We acknowledge the proficiency of the explainer in the given topic through rewards like stars and badges on their profile
